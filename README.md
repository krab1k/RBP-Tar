# RBP-Tar

RBP-Tar is a web-server for the retrieval of experimentally derived binding sites for hundreds of RNA Binding Proteins on the human genome. The web-server is running at https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar.

## Own installation

### Requirements

RBP-Tar was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10, Flask 2.0.1, and SQlite 3.37.

### Setup

The application requires the data in the SQLite database file ``genes.db``, which was excluded from the repository due to its size, to be stored in the application directory. This file can be generated by the [tools/init_db.py](tools/init_db.py) script using the result of the [pipeline](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/rbp_encode_eclip) as an input (a file usually named ``rbp_encode_eclip.csv``).
